# Forms and reports

<!--

  DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY

  See https://github.com/sleepdiary/docs/blob/main/bin/generate-from-resources.js

 -->

Before you make a new form, you might like to take some inspiration from some that already exist.  Or see [the list of specialists](./) to see what your doctor is likely to ask for.

## Forms

A &ldquo;form&rdquo; is a document you fill out.  This section compares the durations and layouts for different forms.

<SortableTable :columns="forms_reports_columns" :rows="forms_rows" />

## Reports

A &ldquo;report&rdquo; is a document generated based on the information in a form.  This section compares the durations and layouts for different reports.

<SortableTable :columns="forms_reports_columns" :rows="reports_rows" />

## Events

An &ldquo;event&rdquo; is anything that happens during a day, which someone might think is relevant to your sleep.  Diaries can ask people to fill out different events, and can use different symbols to represent them.  The table below summarises all known events.

<SortableTable :columns="events_columns" :rows="events_rows" />
