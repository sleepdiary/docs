# Official forms

Sleep professionals often ask people to fill out forms to describe their sleeping patterns.  For example, a doctor might ask patients to record their wake and sleep times, or a researcher might give questionnaires to participants.

The forms on this page are real-world examples, so should give you some idea of things you might be asked.  Or if you're interested in designing new forms, they should give you some ideas to build on.  For example, [the sleepdiary report](/report) is based largely on these forms.

If you are a sleep professional and would like your form added to this page, [please get in touch](https://github.com/sleepdiary/docs/issues/new?title=Please+add+my+form)!  You'll need to provide a blank form and confirm you have permission to share it publicly.  Alternatively, you can publish the form on your own site and provide a link.

## Calendar-style sleep diaries

The most common type of sleep form is the calendar-style sleep diary, which primarily asks people to mark their wake and sleep times.
