# Forms and reports

Sleep professionals often get people to fill out forms, from which they produce reports.  For example, a researcher might give questionnaires to participants or a doctor might calculate their patients' average wake times.

This page is a collection of real-world examples that should give you some idea about the process of analysing sleep.  If you're interested in designing new forms, they should give you some ideas to build on.  In particular, [the sleepdiary report](/report) is based largely on these examples.

If you are a sleep professional and would like something to be added to this page, [please get in touch](https://github.com/sleepdiary/docs/issues/new?title=Please+add+my+forms+and+reports)!  You'll need to provide some examples and confirm you have permission to share them publicly.  Example forms should be blank, and any reports you choose to share can use [simulated data](../patterns/simulate.html) to avoid privacy concerns.  Please mention your preferred data format for reports, so we can generate a simulation in that format.  If you would rather publish on your own site for your patients to download, please provide a URL for us to link to.

## Calendar-style sleep forms

The most common type of sleep form is the calendar-style sleep diary, which primarily asks people to mark their wake and sleep times.

### Comparison

Here is a summary of common differences between calendar-style forms.

[The Sleep Support Project](https://sleepsupportproject.org/about/) are qualified BACP Registered counsellors based in Greater Manchester, UK.  They provide a [downloadable sleep diary](https://sleepsupportproject.org/sleep-diary-2/) on their website.

Patients across the UK report their doctors use sleep diaries with only minor differences.  We haven't identified the original source they're all derived from.

## Calendar-style reports

Reports are often intended for internal use, and may not be designed for readability by people outside the organisation that created them.  You can probably ignore these unless you're interested in designing new reports.
