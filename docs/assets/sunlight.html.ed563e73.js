Here are some common solutions that use blackout fabric."),v=c('<p><strong>Blackout curtains</strong> can work well, and may feel more like a normal bedroom. But even a tiny sliver of daylight can disrupt the illusion of night-time. Sealed blackout blinds provide the best gurantee, but a professional fitter should be able to block out light even with normal blinds. Just make sure they fit the curtain flush against the sides, and add a box pelmet to block light at the top (as shown in the image).</p><p><strong>Blackout roller blinds</strong> are a cheaper alternative. Replace your existing curtains or blinds with fabric you can roll down when you go to bed and roll back when you wake up. Because the roller screws into the wall, you should get a very close fit even if you attach it yourself. But make sure to check with your landlord before making such a permanent modification.</p><p><strong>No-drill blackout blinds</strong> are a decent alternative if you can&#39;t make permanent modifications. These stretch a bar across the recess your window sits in, which can then be used like a normal roller blind.</p><p><strong>Blu-tac blinds</strong> are an even lower-tech alternative - just buy a roll of fabric online and fix it to the window with blu-tac. This is cheaper than the alternatives and works even with bay windows. But it can be cumbersome and you need to be careful not to leave blu-tac anywhere that might leave a mark.</p><h3 id="strengths-and-weaknesses" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#strengths-and-weaknesses" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Strengths and weaknesses</h3><p>Blackout fabric is very effective, gives a professional-looking result, and can be applied with no more skill than it takes to hang up a poster.</p><p>Different solutions have different costs, and it can be particularly expensive if you have large windows and specific requirements. But expense is not a sign of quality - try to get a fabric sample before making a large purchase, to make sure the material is as effective as claimed.</p><p>Solutions that are easier to put up are also more likely to come down accidentally. Blu-tac blinds will soon unstick, and a no-drill bar will eventually slip free. You can just reset them when that happens, but it can be an unpleasant interruption if it happens while you&#39;re asleep.</p><p>Blackout curtains can also help manage the temperature in your bedroom. Open your bedroom door and windows at night to let cool air in, then close them and draw the curtains before dawn to keep warm air out. You should find your room is several degrees cooler even if your primary sleep is in the mid-afternoon.</p><h2 id="home-made-barriers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#home-made-barriers" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Home-made barriers</h2>',10),x=t(" Window obscured by"),B=e("br",null,null,-1),T=t(" wood, fabric and curtains "),j=e("p",null,"If blackout blinds aren't appropriate, there are a variety of alternatives you can make yourself.
