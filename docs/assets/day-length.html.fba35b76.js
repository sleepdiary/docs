Appointments need to be handled carefully if your sleeping pattern is unpredictable. Organisations are unlikely to understand if you say you have a sleeping disorder, so it may be better to say you work shifts and don&#39;t know your timing far in advance. They might let you make two appointments a few hours (or a few weeks) apart, on the understanding you&#39;ll cancel one nearer the time. Or if you know someone else with a similar appointment, you might be able to book two appointments and swap them over if necessary. For example, say you book a morning dental check-up for yourself and an afternoon check-up for a housemate. Then if you find yourself waking up at noon, you can call up and ask for your housemate to take the morning check-up instead.</p><p><strong>Meeting social obligations</strong>. Being around for social events can require planning months in advance. If you&#39;re young and just need to be physically present for someone&#39;s wedding, you might be able to get up in the middle of your night and sit through it. But sleep becomes less elastic as you age, so it becomes increasingly difficult to entertain relatives for the whole of Christmas day. It can take years to get good at scheduling, so it&#39;s better to start now.</p><p>The main things need to know are your <em>minimum long-term day length</em> and your <em>maximum long-term day length</em>. For example, say you normally sleep once every 25 hours, but sometimes you sleep once every 24 or 26 hours for a few weeks at a time. You might assume you&#39;re capable of sustaining that long-term, but if you try it for a few months, you might find your body snaps back to where you would have been if you hadn&#39;t tried at all. The only way to measure your true minimum and maximum is to spend those months trying, fail, pick something closer to your natural average, and keep on trying until you get it right.</p><p>Once you know your minimum and maximum average day length, planning social events becomes a mathematical problem. For example, say you want to wake up at 8am on your birthday, but your normal 25-hour day will have you waking up at 8pm instead. If you can move your average day length up to 15 minutes either way, it will take you at least 48 sleeps to reach your target wake time. So in practice, you might want to start scheduling your sleep up to two months before the big day.</p><h2 id="simulate-this-sleeping-pattern" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#simulate-this-sleeping-pattern" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Simulate this sleeping pattern</h2><p>Some people find they understand their sleeping pattern better if they can compare it to a mathematical model.
