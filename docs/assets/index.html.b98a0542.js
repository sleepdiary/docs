This can be as simple as a paper record of your wake and sleep times, or it can be a record of everything you think might be related, or even a tool to automatically measure your activity.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">TIP</p><p>The best sleep diary is the one you can sustain in the real world</p></div><p>Maintaining a sleep diary is a surprisingly personal experience. You need to think about it in the moments before you close your eyes at night and after you wake up in the morning, so a diary that seems bold when you&#39;re wide awake can be an unmanageable chore as you rub the sleep from your eyes.</p><p>This page discusses several solutions. Pick whichever one you prefer, and don&#39;t be afraid to try things out and switch if they&#39;re not working.</p><h1 id="hand-made-diaries" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hand-made-diaries" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Hand-made diaries</h1><p>The easiest way to get started is to record your sleep in a spreadsheet or on paper.</p><p>The main benefit of a hand-made diary is flexibility. You can add and remove fields when you think of them, and even doodle on a paper diary. This can be useful at first when you&#39;re still learning, but can make analysis hard later on.</p><p>The benefit of a pencil-and paper diary is that it&#39;s completely disconnected from the digital world. You can keep it by your bed, you don&#39;t have to plug it in, and it won&#39;t tempt you to check Twitter. On the other hand, the benefit of a spreadsheet is that you can analyse it or convert it to other formats in future.</p><h2 id="hand-made-tables" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hand-made-tables" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Hand-made tables</h2><p>Some people prefer to record their diary as a table of numbers. This can be easier, because you just write whatever your watch says when you go to bed and wake up.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">TIP</p><p>Write dates in 24-hour format</p></div><p>Hand-made tables may be the easiest way to get started, but they can require more discipline than digital formats. For example, if you see an entry that claims you went to bed at <em>1:30</em> one day last week, you might wonder if you meant to write <em>11:30</em> instead. It&#39;s not hard to think of a solution to that problem, but it can be hard to actually muster the effort in the real world. If you start blaming yourself for not maintaining that discipline, consider switching to a digital solution that will do the boring parts for you.</p><p><a href="SleepTable.xlsx">Download a sleep table</a> you can use or copy for inspiration</p><h2 id="hand-made-graphs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hand-made-graphs" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Hand-made graphs</h2><p>A more visual solution is to mark out 24 columns (or 24 rows), then shade in the times when you&#39;re awake and asleep. You&#39;ll need a ruler to do this on paper, but the result can be more intuitive because you can see your sleeping pattern at a glance.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">TIP</p><p>Make the wake and sleep periods as distinct as possible, preferably by shading boxes to indicate sleep times</p></div><p><a href="SleepGraph.xlsx">Download a sleep graph</a> you can use or copy for inspiration</p><h2 id="sleep-disorder-patient-charts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sleep-disorder-patient-charts" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Sleep Disorder Patient Charts</h2>',19),p=t("The Sleep Disorder Patient Chart, pioneered by "),u={href:"http://sites.utoronto.ca/pain/about-us/profile/harvey-moldofsky.html",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},y=t("Harvey Moldofsky"),m=t(" and "),f={href:"https://www.psychiatry.utoronto.ca/faculty/james-g-macfarlane",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},_=t("James G.
